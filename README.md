#rideshare_app (unfinished)
Rideshare App idea, made to polish skills in Java in Android Studio and UI Design.

## Why make a rideshare app?
There are thousands of vehicles going from the same city to the next. People waste time and money to commute in their everyday lives, especially those who take public transit. Itâ€™s not uncommon for university students to seek rideshares on Facebook groups. Currently known solutions can be unsafe booking rides with unknown drivers for routine trips. This is an unsafe practice, it has no moderation of the ride or confirmation of payment. If you were to go onto one of these pages, you will see an absurdly high volume of users reporting being scammed.

## How can we fix this?
We made an app that helps solve commuting problems for people, making their trips more convenient, reliable and safe. Our app will guide drivers and riders to each other and encourage a convenient routine through our messaging system. Our app allows the user to navigate as a driver and a rider, so even if you are a person with a car that commutes to school sometimes, you can easily search for other rides if you ever need to. Through this project we can also achieve the goal to reduce the CO2 emissions by reducing the total number of cars on the road. This app will also be verifying users and the drivers credentials before they can post.

## Who would use this app?
Users can be of two types: a driver and a rider. For people who are looking for rides for their longer commute, and also people who commute in their own cars but are looking to cut down on their expenses by sharing the gas money.

As a rider, we want to book a ride which is reliable, safe and, budget friendly unlike Uber which prices are catered towards drivers using this app as their job. Drivers on this app would be using the app as a convienience to them as they are going to be traveling to the given city anyways. Users can navigate through the app and book their ride within time constraints and can also communicate with the driver or passengers with the inbuilt messaging system.

## Design Overview
One of our goals was to create an accessible app with clear design affordances. To do so, we designed an app with users in mind. making use of space with multiple sections, visual icons along with text. For example, the bottom bar has text along with icons, to find the inbox u simply are able to select that icon making things very simple. A key development feature is the section of ride listings. To display ride postings, we implemented a RecyclerView. In addition to that, when a ride is clicked on, more details of the ride are displayed.

## Future Implementations
Payment Authentication - to avoid payment conflict, we will implement payment gateway.
Google Maps - To create a more complex, appealing app, we should add live locations of the users on the trip along with the visual aid to show the route when booking the ride.
ID Verification - Safety is our #1 priority. We need a level of user verification such as phone number confirmation for all users and a car/license verification to ensure drivers are certified.
